# OpenQTSim Notebooks

This is the repository with examples for the [OpenQTSim](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenQTSim) package. 

The package documentation can be found [here](https://openqtsim.readthedocs.io).

## Example notebooks

The benefit of OpenQTSim is the generic set-up. This makes it straightforward to experiment with different aspects of queueing simulations. A number of examples are presented in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenQTSim-Notebooks/tree/master/notebooks).

Check the information on how to get started either way.
